        <h2>Digital Multimeter</h2>
        <b>Theory</b>
        <ol>
		<li>Measuring human resistance
			- Configure the DMM to measure resistance.
			- Grab each lead with a different hand.
			- If you cannot get a reading, you can by licking your fingers.
			- The DMM puts a battery voltage between its leads when measuring resistance.
			Calculate the current that flew through your body when doing this experiment.
			- Explain your results.</li>
		<li>Measuring voltage and current with a multimeter
			1. Connect the meter, making sure the leads are the correct way round.
			Digital meters can be safely connected in reverse, but an analogue meter may be damaged.
			2. If the reading goes off the scale: immediately disconnect and select a higher range.
			Multimeters are easily damaged by careless use so please take these</li>
		<li>precautions:
			 Always disconnect the multimeter before adjusting the range switch.
			 Always check the setting of the range switch before you connect to a circuit.
			 Never leave a multimeter set to a current range (except when actually taking a reading).
			The greatest risk of damage is on the current ranges because the meter has a low resistance.</li>
		<li>Testing a diode with a digital multimeter
			 Digital multimeters have a special setting for testing a diode, usually labelled with the diode symbol .
			 Connect the red (+) lead to the anode and the black (-) to
			the cathode. The diode should conduct and the meter will
			display a value (usually the voltage across the diode in mV, 1000mV = 1V).
			 Reverse the connections. The diode should NOT conduct this way so the
			meter will display "off the scale" (usually blank except for a 1 on the left).</li>
		<li> Testing a transistor with a multimeter
			Set a digital multimeter to diode test, as described above for testing a diode.
			Test each pair of leads both ways (six tests in total):
			 The base-emitter (BE) junction should behave like a diode and conduct one way only.
			 The base-collector (BC) junction should behave like a diode and conduct one way only.
			 The collector-emitter (CE) should not conduct either way.
			The diagram shows how the junctions behave in an NPN transistor. The diodes are reversed in a PNP transistor but the same test procedure can be used.
		<li>Types of transistor
			There are two types of standard transistors, NPN and PNP, with different circuit symbols. The letters refer to the layers of semiconductor material used to make the transistor. Most transistors used today are NPN because this is the easiest type to make from silicon. If you are new to electronics it is best to start by learning how to use NPN transistors.
			The leads are labelled base (B), collector (C) and emitter (E).
			These terms refer to the internal operation of a transistor but they are not much help in understanding how a transistor is used, so just treat them as labels!</li>
		<li>Diodes
			a = anode
			k = cathode
			Testing an NPN transistor
			Transistor circuit symbols
		<li>A Darlington pair is two transistors connected together to give a very high current gain.
			In addition to standard (bipolar junction) transistors, there are field-effect transistors which are usually referred to as FETs. They have different circuit symbols and properties and they are not (yet) covered by this experiment.
			Connecting Transistors have three leads which must be connected the correct way round. Please take care with this because a wrongly connected transistor may be damaged instantly when you switch on.
			If you are lucky the orientation of the transistor will be clear from the PCB or stripboard layout diagram, otherwise you will need to refer to a supplier's catalogue to identify the leads.
			The drawings on the right show the leads for some of the most common case styles.
			Please note that transistor lead diagrams show the view from below with the leads towards you. This is the opposite of IC (chip) pin diagrams which show the view from above.</li>
		<li>Soldering
			Transistors can be damaged by heat when soldering so if you are not an expert it is wise to use a heat sink clipped to the lead between the joint and the transistor body. A standard crocodile clip can be used as a heat sink.
			Do not confuse this temporary heat sink with the permanent heat sink (described below) which may be required for a power transistor to prevent it overheating during operation.
			Transistor leads for some common case styles.
			Crocodile clip 7</li>
		<li>Heat sinks
			Waste heat is produced in transistors due to the current flowing through them. Heat sinks are needed for power transistors because they pass large currents. If you find that a transistor is becoming too hot to touch it certainly needs a heat sink! The heat sink helps to dissipate (remove) the heat by transferring it to the surrounding air.</li>
