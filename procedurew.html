        <b>Procedure</b>
	<ol>
                <li> The spectrometer and prism table are leveled mechanically and optically.</li>
		<li> The telescope is turned towards a distinct object and the focus knob is adjusted until a distinct image of the object is obtained in the field of view of telescope.</li>
		<li> The slit is observed through the collimator and it is made sharp by moving it and adjusting aperture.</li>
		<li> The telescope is brought in line with collimator and the width of slit is adjusted to get fine and sharp slit in the field of view of telescope,</li>
		<li> The telescope and collimator are adjusted for parallel fight by Schuster's method telescope is adjusted to receive the image of the slit in the field of view, at the position vertical cross wire so that axes of telescope and collimator are in straight line.</li>
		<li> Note the position of telescope on the circular scale (A).Add~90^{\circ} to this value and turn telese at this new position (A+90^{\circ}). Fix the telescope at this position. Here axis of telescope right angle to axis of collimator.</li>
		<li> The given grating is carefully mounted on the prism table such that the grating surface perpendicular to prism table.</li>
		<li> The prism table is suitably rotated such that image of the slit reflected from the grating surf is obtained at the center of view of telescope. In this position the parallel rays of light falling collimator are at 45° angle on the grating surface.</li>
		<li> Reading of the spectrometer is noted (B).45^{\circ} is added in this reading and prism table is rotate to this new position (B+45^{\circ}) . The grating surface is now normal to the incident light comi from collimator. Fix the prism table at this position.</li>
		<li> Rotate the telescope on both sides of slit.</li>
		<li> Adjust the telescope on first color on I.H.S. and note the reading and repeat the procedure all color in I^{a} order on L.H.S.
		<li> Turn telescope slit on I.H.S. where 2^{nd} order spectrum starts. Note down readings for 2 spectrum on L.H.S. and same procedure is repeated for 1 & 2 order on R.H.S. also.
		<li> Note the difference in angles at L.H.S. and R.H.S. for each color (\theta_{L}-\theta_{R})/2. Calculate wave length of each spectral line using the appropriate formula = [(d sin 0)/m] A" (form I and 2)
                <li> <b>Formula</b>:- Wavelength of spectral line (2) [(d sin om)/m) A Where, λ is wavelength of spectral fine (A°) d is grating element = 2.54/15000 cm Be is angle of diffraction for m" order of diffraction mis order of diffraction</li>
