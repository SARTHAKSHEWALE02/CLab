        <b>Theory</b>
	<ul>
                <li>The particles are pushed to the tube’s bottom by centrifugal force. During the rinse cycle, the centripetal force principle is applied. By acting from the exterior to the inside of the washing machine, this force produces a space that resembles a vacuum in the middle. A liquid’s chemical or physical activity is enhanced by forced circulation or another periodic motion (like stirring). The clothes bounce back and forth inside the water and detergent-filled drum of the washing machine as it moves, rubbing up against one another to remove stains.</li>
		<li>Important Points of Working Principle of Washing Machine:
			The centrifugal and centripetal forces are how washing machines operate. The two main cycles of operation for washing machines. The wash cycle and the rinse cycle are these.The centrifugal force principle is used throughout the washing process. Since the force is applied from the interior to the outside, the cloth is completely washed in the soapy water poured into the machine.</li>

		<li>If the rotation’s axis coincides with the coordinate system’s origin, the centrifugal force will be directed radially outward from that point.
			A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that rotates anything around a fixed axis while applying a strong force perpendicular to the spin axis.
			By spinning at 800-1600 rpm to help soap and grime leave the cloth’s surface and into outlet pipes, a washing machine employs centrifugation to clean and partially dry the clothes placed into it.
			A hypothetical force with the same magnitude and dimensions as the centripetal force but acting in the opposite direction is known as the centrifugal force, which is specific to particles moving in a circle.</li>
