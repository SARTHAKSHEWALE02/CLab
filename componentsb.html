        <h2>Seat belt systems</h2>
        <b>Components</b>
	<ul>
                <li>Webbing: The fabric that makes up the belt itself, called webbing, is carefully designed to have extreme tensile strength—about 3000-6000 lbs. They prevent a huge number of deaths each year, and have done so since they were adopted by the automotive industry in the 1950s.</li>
		<li>Piller Loop : The pillar loop is used in a 3-point seat belt system. It is the piece above the shoulder of the passenger, and is used to guide the webbing over the shoulder and across the chest of the passenger.</li>
		<li>Latch Plate : Some vehicles have a switchable latchplate that uses a button to move from the unlocked position for adults to the locked position for car seats (children). While all seat belts will lock in a crash, not all seat belts have a latchplate that will lock to secure a car seat.</li>
		<li>Buckle : The buckle is the piece of the seat belt system that secures and releases the tongue, which is attached to the webbing. The buckle is designed to hold the tongue firmly and allow the seat belt to be fastened and unfastened with very little force.</li>
		<li>Retractor : The retractor allows the webbing to be pulled in and out as the occupant places the belt on or off. The buckle allows for the easy attachment of the belt by the occupant. The anchor provides the 3rd connection to the vehicle.</li>
       </ul>
